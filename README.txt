WORK SAMPLE FOR SOFTWARE DEV POSITIONS

The following scripts were produced in the following order:

1_Levenshtein_Recursive_Groovy
2_Levenshtein_Iterative_Java
3_Levenshtein_Iterative_JS

I produced the first when we needed a simple script to calculate the edit distance between two strings, i.e., the number of character changes, additions, and deletions needed to convert one string to another.

Eventually we discovered that we needed a version that was more performant; I was asked to ditch Groovy for Java and use an iterative method. Finally it was determined that we needed a similar version in JavaScript.

The fundamental algorithm is not my own, of course - the recursive algorithm was invented by Levenshtein, and the matrix iterative version is also available from a few sources online. However the conversion of those algorithms into three different code bases was my own work and demonstrates my ability to handle congitively challenging problems with a brief period of training. At the time these scripts were written I had been writing code in each of these languages for less than six months.
